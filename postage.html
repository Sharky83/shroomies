      <h2>Postage</h2>
      Welcome to the Shroomies Experience! 📦✨ At Shroomies, postage is a flat
      fee, no matter how many items you add to your cart! We can fit up to six
      items in one magical box, and if you order seven or more, we’ll cover the
      cost of the second box’s postage. More shrooms, more fun, more savings –
      it’s as simple as that! Customs and VAT fees may apply depending on your
      country – we’re not wizards when it comes to predicting these, as they
      vary from place to place. Your package will be shipped with the customs
      code for “vegetable byproduct.” This new regulation applies EU-wide and
      isn’t a result of Brexit. Unfortunately, there’s no way around it!
      Everything we post is totally legal here in the UK (magic mushroom spores
      are legal to possess in most parts of the world), but it’s your
      responsibility to check the laws in your area. Better safe than sorry,
      right? **Posting Days:** Orders paid by 5pm UK time will be sent out the
      very next day! We’re now packing your precious items in the evenings to
      speed things up. You’ll receive an email from our website once you’ve
      ordered, once we’ve seen your payment, and again when your parcel is with
      the friendly post person. Tracking info (if you opted for it) will be
      included in that email. 📬 Remember: magic mushroom spores are strictly
      for microscopy use only. Don’t get any funny ideas about growing magic
      mushrooms – that’s a no-go, and we won’t support any mischief. If we
      suspect you’re up to no good, we’ll have to blacklist you – sorry but it’s
      the law not our choice. We take pride in our premium quality spore
      syringes, ensuring they are securely and discreetly packaged. Your
      microscopy hobby is your business, and we’re here to support it every step
      of the way! 🔬 Stay shroomy, stay curious, and happy exploring! 🌟🍄

        At Shroomies, we rely on Royal Mail for all our shipping needs. We offer
        delivery options for the UK, EU, and just about everywhere else! We’re
        happy to ship to any country where receiving our products is legal.
        However, if you're in Australia, you might encounter some challenges.
        For those outside the UK, we highly recommend choosing tracked shipping.
        While it’s ultimately your choice, only tracked shipments come with
        insurance. This means if something goes wrong, we can only assist if we
        know where your package is! Got special packaging requests? Shoot us a
        message! We’re flexible and can pack your order just the way you want.
        Please note, we cannot send spore syringes without a customs label.
        Attempting to do so would result in the package being discarded, and no
        one wants that! Have an amazing day! 🌟🍄
